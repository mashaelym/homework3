	<h1> Mashael Almoqbel </h1>
	<h1> Welcome to my Webpage! </h1>
 <div>
	<p> My name is Mashael and I am from Saudi Arabia. I came to the states about three years ago and lived a while in Iowa to work on my English and GRE. I live in NJ with my husband and baby whom I love to spend time with. We like to barbeque, play mini golf, and travel a lot! </p>
	<p> My major is Information Systems and I have a background in management and accounting. I have learned Java and SQL and would love to learn more programming languages. I have an experience of one year and a half as a teaching assistant and I would like to work in academia. </p>
